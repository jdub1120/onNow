### New in this fork (recent)
These are additions on top of upstream behaviour (current fork **`package.json`** version is **2.1.0**).

| Area | What changed |
|------|----------------|
| **Release notice** | After an upgrade, a **red banner** on the **home poster view**, **`/now-showing`**, and **settings** pages reminds you that new features shipped. It clears after you open **Settings** and click **Acknowledge there are new features**. Your choice is stored in `settings.json` (`newFeaturesAcknowledgedVersion`); the banner comes back when the app **version string** in `package.json` changes again (any **X.Y.Z** bump). |
| **Settings → About** | Identifies this app as **PosterX** (a **binarygeek119** fork of Posterr), **purely AI-modified**, with a link to **[github.com/binarygeek119/posterrX](https://github.com/binarygeek119/posterrX)**. Original author credits and upstream links stay in the same tab. |
| **Settings navigation** | **Sync**, **Cache**, **Now Showing**, and **TMDB API** pages use the **same sidebar and mobile icons** as each other, including **Debug** and **About**, so entries no longer disappear when you switch pages. |
| **Ads (main deck + `/settings/ads`)** | When **Enabled**, ad slides rotate with the home posters (**every *n* posters**, optional **only show ads**). Upload images, prices, and optional per-slide backgrounds; metadata in **`config/ads.db`**, files under **`config/ads`**. |
| **Dedicated `/ads` view** | Full-screen ad slideshow: **seconds per ad** advances each slide; **seconds on full `/ads` page before returning home** is separate (`0` = manual leave; otherwise **30–86400** seconds then redirect to **`/`**). Optional backdrop from **`config/ads-view`** (`**/custom/ads-view/**`). |

### Display controls (this modified branch)
 - Per-media poster toggles:
   - Display movie and TV posters
   - Display albums
   - Display books and audiobooks
 - Optional metadata pills:
   - Show cast, directors, authors, and album artist
 - Optional featured portrait modes:
   - Display actors and actresses
   - Display director portrait
   - Show author portrait
   - Display artist portrait
 - Featured portrait modes can render a person/artist image as the main poster, show their name in the top banner, and show up to 5 related credits in the bottom line when metadata is available.
 - Now Screening/Now Playing support includes music and audiobooks (in addition to movies/TV) for supported servers.
 - **Dedicated Now Showing view (`/now-showing`):** TMDB-backed list with **auto showtimes** spaced by **feature runtime + 10 minutes** between each listed time (manual times unchanged when you choose “manual” per title). Optional **library fillers** sample the same on-demand title pool as poster slides; fillers are excluded when they match a curated title (by normalized name).
 - **Settings → Ads:** enable ads, spacing (**every *n* posters**), **only show ads**, currency, title outline on `/ads`, **seconds per ad** on `/ads` (slide rotation), **seconds on the full `/ads` page before returning home** (separate timer; returns to home posters at **`/`** when non-zero). Manage slides and optional per-slide backgrounds on **`/settings/ads`**; open the dedicated view at **`/ads`**.
 - **Settings layout:** **Now Playing (media server)** and **Now Showing (main poster)** sections are ordered with **Now Playing first** in the accordion and related settings shortcuts.
 - **Poster / library sync:** manual **full sync** and **abort** from **Settings → Sync**; optional **About sync** modal. Jellyfin/Emby library paging: optional env **`POSTERR_JELLYFIN_LIBRARY_PAGE_LIMIT`** (integer **50–500**, default **300**) for items per request during large library walks.

### Free community custom posters
Community-sourced, open-use custom poster images for PosterX (and similar apps) live in **[binarygeek119/open-custom-posters](https://github.com/binarygeek119/open-custom-posters)**. Use them in your **`public/custom`** / Docker **`custom`** picture themes; open an issue to request more, or submit a pull request with your art in a folder named for your GitHub username. Discord: [open-custom-posters](https://discord.gg/AEhVjqX4Af).

---
## Prerequisites
### Mandatory
 - Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, or Kodi (settings → server type; Kodi needs HTTP JSON-RPC enabled)

### Optional
 - Sonarr
 - Radarr
 - Readarr (or Chaptarr-compatible book stack)
 - **TMDB API key** (for Now Showing movie search, list, and artwork) — set in **Settings → TMDB API** or **`TMDB_API_KEY`** environment variable
---

## Installation
Installation details are as follows:
### <ins>Docker Compose (X86, ARM64)</ins>
Create the following directories in your docker folder:
 - ./docker/posterr
 - ./docker/posterr/config
 - ./docker/posterr/custom

```yaml
services:
  posterr:
    image: binarygeek119/posterrx:latest
    container_name: posterr
    environment:
      TZ: Australia/Brisbane
      BASEPATH: ""
    volumes:
      - ./docker/posterr/config:/usr/src/app/config
      - ./docker/posterr/custom:/usr/src/app/public/custom
    ports:
      - 9876:3000
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Linux: reach Plex/Jellyfin/Emby/Kodi running on the Docker host (not needed on all setups).
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

#### Docker: mount `config` so settings **and** cache survive restarts

The **`config`** volume is required not only for **`settings.json`**, but also for everything under **`config/cache/`** on the container:

| Path (inside container) | Purpose |
|-------------------------|---------|
| `config/settings.json` | PosterX settings |
| `config/posterr-poster-metadata.db` | Poster / library sync metadata (SQLite) |
| `config/now-showing.db` | TMDB **Now Showing** movie list (dedicated `/now-showing` screen and optional main-poster slides) |
| `config/ads.db` | **Ads** slide list (titles, prices, paths) for **`/ads`** and the main poster deck |
| `config/ads/` · `config/ads-view/` | Uploaded **ad images** and optional **full-page `/ads` backdrop** (served as **`/custom/ads/`** and **`/custom/ads-view/`**) |
| `config/cache/imagecache/` | Downloaded posters, fan art, and related images |
| `config/cache/mp3cache/` | Cached TV/movie theme MP3s |
| `config/cache/randomthemes/` | Optional random theme storage |

Mount **one host folder** to **`/usr/src/app/config`** (as in the Compose example). PosterX creates `cache/` and subfolders on first use. If this path is not persisted on the host, **settings, poster sync, and cached artwork are lost** when the container is recreated.

**Older setups** used a separate **`saved`** volume. That layout is deprecated: on the host directory you mount as **`config`**, create **`cache/`** and move in the old **`saved/imagecache`**, **`saved/mp3cache`**, and **`saved/posterr-poster-metadata.db`** (so inside the container they appear as **`config/cache/...`**).

#### Media servers (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Kodi) in Docker
PosterX only needs **outbound HTTP(S)** to your server — no extra packages in the image.

| Where the server runs | What to enter as **host** in PosterX settings |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Another container** on the same Compose network | The **service name** (e.g. `jellyfin`, `emby`) and that service’s port (often `8096`). |
| **Same machine as Docker, outside containers** (typical Kodi / bare-metal Plex) | `host.docker.internal` (with `extra_hosts` as above on **Linux**; Docker Desktop often works without it). |
| **Another machine on your LAN** | That machine’s IP or hostname (container must be able to route to it). |

**Kodi:** set server type to **Kodi**, port to Kodi’s **Web server / JSON-RPC** port (often **8080**), and **Token** only if HTTP auth is enabled in Kodi (otherwise leave blank).

Example **Jellyfin + PosterX** on one stack: see [`docker-compose.media-servers.example.yml`](docker-compose.media-servers.example.yml). Start with:

`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.media-servers.example.yml up -d`

Then set server type to **Jellyfin**, host **`jellyfin`**, port **8096**, and your API key.

### <ins>Docker CLI (X86, ARM64)</ins>
Create the following directories in your docker folder:
 - ./docker/posterr
 - ./docker/posterr/config
 - ./docker/posterr/custom

```
docker run -d --name posterr \
-p 9876:3000 \
-v ~/docker/posterr/config:/usr/src/app/config \
-v ~/docker/posterr/custom:/usr/src/app/public/custom \
-e TZ=Australia/Brisbane \
--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
--restart=always \
binarygeek119/posterrx:latest
```

On **Docker Engine 20.10+**, `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` lets PosterX reach Plex/Jellyfin/Emby/Kodi running on the **host** (Linux). Omit if you only use container-to-container names on a custom network.

#### Details
|Option|Details|
|--|--|
|TZ|Your local timezone. Go to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and use the `TZ Database Name` value.|
|/docker/posterr/config → `/usr/src/app/config`|**Required.** Holds `settings.json` **and** the **`cache/`** subtree (poster SQLite DB, `imagecache/`, `mp3cache/`). Use a persistent host directory so nothing is lost on container recreate.|
|/docker/posterr/custom|Mount for **custom picture** themes under `public/custom` (omit if you do not use them)|
|Ports|Change first part to a different port if needed. e.g. 9876:3000|
|BASEPATH|`"/your-prefix"` for reverse proxies that serve PosterX under a subpath. Omit or leave empty if unused.|
|extra_hosts `host.docker.internal`|Helps PosterX reach **Jellyfin, Emby, Kodi, or Plex on the Docker host** from inside the container (Linux). Requires Docker Engine **20.10+**. |

### <ins>Unraid</ins>
 - Install via **Docker** using the Compose or `docker run` examples above, or a Community Applications template if one matches this image.

---
## CEC Control script installation **(rPi only)**
 - Install instructions are located [HERE](/scripts/scriptdoco.md)

---
## Updates
 - **Settings** may show an **update available** notice when PosterX’s remote version check reports a **newer version** than this install (see startup logs / settings UI).
 - **This fork:** after upgrading to a new **app version**, a **red “new features”** banner appears until **Settings → Acknowledge there are new features** (see **New in this fork**).
 - Optional: [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) or your stack’s policy for container updates.

---
## Setup
Get to the settings page in a number of ways:
 - On initial load, you will be prompted.
 - Change the URL to _'http://hostIP:9876/settings'_ (where `hostIP` is the IP number of the machine that PosterX is installed on. Change the port number if you set a different value. 3000 is the default for the binary executables)
 - Clicking on the top banner title of any slide.
 - If on the 'no content' page, then click this text

*The default password is:* **raidisnotabackup**

**Now Showing (this fork):** configure the TMDB movie list at **`/settings/now-showing`** (also linked from **Settings**). The public-style schedule view is at **`/now-showing`** (prefix with `BASEPATH` if you use a reverse-proxy base path). For reduced animation/scroll load on low-powered devices, use **`/now-showing?lowPower=1`**. Set a TMDB API key in **Settings → TMDB API** or the **`TMDB_API_KEY`** environment variable.

**Ads (this fork):** configure slides and timings at **`/settings/ads`**. The dedicated slideshow is at **`/ads`**; use **seconds per ad** for each slide and **seconds on full `/ads` page before returning home** to auto-navigate back to the home poster view when you want a timed lobby loop.

---
## Possible Uses
 - Mount a monitor on your wall and showcase your home media setup
 - Use it on a second monitor to keep an eye on what is running
 - Run it on a small screen mounted outside your theater room to show when a movie is in progress
 - Use a reverse proxy, or port-forward, to let your friends see what is playing, available, and coming soon

---
